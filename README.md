# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-ML-Algorithms

This GitHub repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties. The project utilizes two powerful machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Gradient Boosting.
<br />
Dataset:<br />
The dataset used in this project consists of various attributes such as acidity, pH level, alcohol content, etc., along with a quality rating for each sample of red wine. These attributes serve as features for training the machine learning models, while the quality rating serves as the target variable.
<br />
Algorithms Implemented:
<br />
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.<br />
In this project, KNN is employed to predict the quality of red wine based on the similarity of the features to those of its nearest neighbors.<br />

Gradient Boosting:<br />
Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds a series of weak learners (usually decision trees) sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.<br />
In this project, Gradient Boosting is utilized to improve the predictive accuracy of the model by minimizing errors and optimizing the quality predictions.<br />

Results:<br />
The performance of both KNN and Gradient Boosting models is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are discussed and compared.
